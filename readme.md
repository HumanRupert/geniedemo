# Quantitative Developer Assignment
**Description**: In this coding assignment, you will be tasked with implementing various portfolio optimization models, utilizing cryptocurrency historical data for portfolio risk management. The assignment aims to test your knowledge and skills in quantitative finance, portfolio management, and coding in Python. You will work with financial data, perform calculations, and design algorithms to optimize portfolios and manage risk effectively.

## Instructions:
### Retrieve Data:
- Use historical price data (1-day timeframe) for a set of cryptocurrencies from an exchange / data provider of your choice.
- Select at least 10-20 different assets with sufficient historical data.
### Preprocess Data:
- Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and any other necessary data preprocessing steps.
- Calculate the daily and cumulative returns for each asset.
### Implement Portfolio Optimization Models:
- Implement the following portfolio optimization models: a. Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz Model) b. Minimum Variance Portfolio c. Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
- Design functions that take asset returns as input and return the optimal weights for each asset.
- Functions should accept a flag indicating whether shorting is possible or not.
### Evaluate and Compare Portfolios:
- Compute the daily performance for each portfolio with a daily, weekly, and monthly rebalancing rule.
- Calculate and compare portfolio statistics, including expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios (and other relevant stats) for each optimization model and rebalancing rule.
- Compute the daily performance for each portfolio with a long-only or long-short rules (when relevant for the optimization model).
Visualize the efficient frontier and the optimal portfolios.

## Deliverables:
- Python script(s) implementing the portfolio optimization models, risk management strategies, and overlay strategy.
- Documentation explaining your approach, assumptions made, and any additional insights.
- Any additional files or plots that support your implementation and analysis.
- Please enclose your files in a .zip file and return it to federico@genieai.tech within one week.

## Note:
- You can use any relevant libraries for data retrieval, preprocessing, optimization, risk management, and visualization.
- Make sure to provide appropriate comments in your code for clarity and readability.
- Remember to include sample input data and expected output to demonstrate the functionality of your code.
- Keep your code well-structured and organized.
- Feel free to add any extra features or functionalities that you think would enhance the overall assignment.
